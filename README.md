# Shopping-Predictor-Model
This model predicts if a online shopper will purchase an item or not. Using scikitlearn and a K-nearest-neighbor model I am able to predict if a customer will buy something or not based off of many different factors like what day it is, if it's a holiday, if they have bought something before from the same site, etc.
